# go-digital-menu 
Implementing Alef Menu with GoLang. 
While learning golang with this project, trying to make a smaller version of Alef Digital Menu that I made using FastAPI,
but this time in golang and with no orders or delivery maybe will implement that later after finishing the smaller vanilla version.
